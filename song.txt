Mmmmhhh mhmm
Yeah yeah
Holy diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean
Gotta get away
Holy diver, yeah
Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you
Look out
